# Reproducible Research Training Schedule - FY24
The following training courses are planned for FY24. Courses are open to all Bank staff and consultants.
Please contact reproducibility@worldbank.org for further information or to request a registration link.

### Using GitHub for Reproducible and Transparent Research
A virtual, hands-on training for research teams interested in transitioning their work to GitHub.
An introductory session explains how GitHub increases transparency and reproducibility and introduces GitHub workflows.
Targeted follow-up sessions discuss in detail the ways different team members will interact with the platform,
from observer to contributor and repository maintainer.
- September, November, February, May

### Reproducible Research Fundamentals (Stata + R)
This week-long course introduces the best practices for reproducible research through lecture and hands-on practice.
Participants learn how to implement transparent and reproducible workflows,
to effectively code in a team environment, and to keep personal data secure throughout the lifecycle of a research project.
Participants will practice the material covered in lectures during hands-on lab sessions.
Labs will be delivered separately in Stata and R, with novice and advanced tracks.
By the end of the course, participants will have the tools and knowledge to implement best practices for transparent and reproducible research.
- September 25-29, 2023

### Creating a Reproducibility Package
This 1-hour hybrid seminar provides an overview of the necessary components of a reproducibility package.
It offers practical guidance for preparing reproducibility packages for World Bank research.
- October, December, February, April

### Common Reasons Research Papers Fail to Reproduce
	This 1-hour hybrid seminar discusses common reasons reproducibility packages are not verified as initially submitted,
  using evidence from reproducibility verifications of World Bank research.
  It offers practical guidance to improve research reproducibility.
  - November, April

### Reproducible Research Bootcamps
These 1-day in-person intensive trainings are offered by request, to specific teams or units.
The objective is to explain reproducible research practices and then do hands-on sessions directly with participants to provide customized technical support and facilitate real-time adoption.
Exact content will be agreed in advance with the requesting team. Possible content includes creating GitHub repositories, setting up project directories, organizing analysis through a main script.
- Available on request

### Peer code review
This is a facilitated, structured code exchange which improves the quality and reproducibility of code in real time. Peer review is appropriate for any stage of a research project that has a concrete code output. The diagnostic shared at the end of the process provides staff with specific and actionable feedback and a multi-faceted assessment of their research assistantâ€™s coding. Participants also learn from each other about how to write high-quality, reproducible code, and see firsthand how to implement different coding practices.
- next round will be in November 2023, to participate please email dimeanalytics@worldbank.org
