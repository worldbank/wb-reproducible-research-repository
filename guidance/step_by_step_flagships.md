# 🧭 Building a Reproducibility Package (Flagship Edition)

**World Bank Reproducible Research Initiative**  🔗 [reproducibility.worldbank.org](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org)

## 📦 What Is a Reproducibility Package?

A reproducibility package includes everything needed to replicate the findings in a paper:

| Includes | Details |
|----------|---------|
| 📑 **Documentation** | README, Data Availability Statement (DAS), figure/table mapping |
| 📂 **Code** | All code files required to go from the original data to the results in the paper |
| 📊 **Data** | All raw data needed and/or detailed access instructions to obtain it |

> 💻 **Standard: Computational Reproducibility**  
> A third party can reproduce the **exact findings** in the paper using the data, code, and documentation provided by the author.

✅ Verified packages are published in the [Reproducible Research Repository](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org). (RRR)

## 🔁 Reproducibility Workflow

| Step               | What Happens                                                                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Submission**   | Authors prepare the reproducibility package and [submit it for verification](https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/prwp_reproducibility). |
| **Verification** | The reproducibility team tests whether the results can be fully reproduced using the submitted code and data. A detailed verification report is issued. |
| **Publication**  | If reproducible, the package is published on the [Reproducible Research Repository (RRR)](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org) with a DOI, metadata, and verification seal. |

## 📦 Components of a Good Reproducibility Package — *Flagships*

📌 **Flagship projects typically involve multiple datasets, chapters, and contributors**, which adds complexity to reproducibility. The table below outlines the essential components of a high-quality package, with specific tips to support coordination and transparency in flagship workflows.

| Component             | Description & Flagship-Specific Tips                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **README File**       | 📌 **Critical for flagships**: Serves as the main guide for replicators.<br><br>— Provide step-by-step instructions for how to run the code and reproduce results.<br>— Include a **list of exhibits**, indicating which are generated by the package and which are taken from external sources (with citations).<br>— Include a Data Availability Statement (see below).<br>— If the project structure is complex (e.g., organized by chapter or module), describe the folder layout to help others navigate it.<br><br>🔗 **Use our templates**: [Markdown](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/README_Template.md) · [Word](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/README_Template.docx) |
| **Data Availability Statement (DAS)** | 📌 **Essential for flagships**: These often use a mix of public, restricted, and internal datasets.<br><br>— List **every dataset** used, regardless of size or access level.<br>— Clearly describe the **access conditions** for each dataset: e.g., public (include URL), restricted (how the team obtained it), or internal WB access only (with process and a contact name if possible).<br>— Include the **access date**, since datasets may be updated before project completion.<br><br>🔗 [Example DAS for Flagship](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/250/download/731) |
| **Code Files**        | 📁 Organize scripts by task (e.g., `cleaning.R`, `analysis.do`), and manage them with a single main script (`main.R`, `main.do`, or equivalent).<br><br>— List all dependencies explicitly (e.g., R packages, ado files, Python libraries).<br>📌 For flagships: Use a **modular structure by chapter or module**, and agree on folder naming and structure across all contributors. <br><br>🔗 **Use our templates**: [Stata](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/main.do) · [R](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/main.R)|
| **Data**              | 📌 Data is often the trickiest part for flagships due to mmultiple sources.<br><br>— Keep **raw** and **processed** data in separate folders.<br>— Document **all** data transformations **in code**. If manual edits were made, explain them in the README.<br>— Remove any unused datasets before submission.<br>— If using internally produced data (e.g., from other WB teams), provide as much detail as possible: include dataset title, source team, contact person (if applicable), and whether it could be shared on DDH/MDL under a restricted license.<br>📌 Maintain consistent dataset versions across chapters and authors, and store original data in permanent, team-accessible locations. |
| **Final Outputs**     | 📤 Include all raw outputs used in the paper (e.g., CSVs, LaTeX tables, plots).<br><br>📌 If any outputs were sent to the design/publication team, specify which ones to avoid mismatches between the paper and the package. |

## 🚧 Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| 🚫 Problem | ✅ Solution |
|-----------|-------------|
| Version control. Code results ≠ Report exhibits | Run full code right before submission and make sure outputs match your manuscript. Archive final outputs. |
| Manual Excel edits not documented | Document all manual steps (e.g., which Excel tab → which figure). Automate when possible. |
| Starts from intermediate data | Archive raw data + document **entire** cleaning pipeline. |
| Instability. Results vary across runs | Control random seeds. Test stability. Contact reproducibility team for help. |

## 🚀 Start Early: Timeline & Submission Steps

| 📅 Phase               | Action Items                                                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kickoff**            | - Assign a reproducibility lead per chapter or module<br>- Define folder and file structure for the whole team<br>- Align on data sources and archive raw versions from day 1 |
| **During project**     | - Update README and DAS progressively<br>- Automate figures/tables as much as possible<br>- Keep scripts modular and coordinated across chapters |
| **Before submission**  | - Run the entire pipeline using your `main` script<br>- Clean the repository: only include necessary data, code, and outputs<br>- Ensure exhibits match the report exactly <br>- Review our [checklist](https://worldbank.github.io/wb-reproducible-research-repository/reproducibility_package_checklist.html) to make sure everything is ready |
| **To submit**          | Fill out the [Reproducibility Verification Request Form](https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/prwp_reproducibility) and share your package |

💡 Start documenting from day 1—it will save time at submission.
