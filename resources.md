# Resources for Reproducibility

This section provides useful templates, main files, and environment setup instructions to help you build reproducibility packages efficiently.

## README Templates
- [README Template (Markdown)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/refs/heads/main/resources/README_Template.md)  
  *Use this as a guide if you're working on a reproducibility package to include all required elements.*

- [README Template (Word)](./resources/README_Template.docx)  
  *Same content as the Markdown template but in Word format.*

- [README Generator](https://dime-worldbank.github.io/wb-reproducible-research-repository-automation/)  
  *Use this tool to create your own README.* The app includes all the essential components of a high-quality README and will generate a Word document based on your responses.

## Main Files for Reproducibility

These are templates for main scripts to allow **one-click reproducibility** in both **R** and **Stata**. Use them to automate your replication process:

- **R Main File:** [main.R](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/main.R)  
- **Stata Main File:** [main.do](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/main.do)

## Environment Setup Instructions

Itâ€™s important to isolate your environment to ensure reproducibility. Follow the links below for detailed instructions on environment setup:

- **Python Environment Setup:** [Python Instructions](./resources/environment-instructions/python.md)
- **R Environment Setup:** [R Instructions](./resources/environment-instructions/R.md)
- **Stata Environment Setup:** [Stata Instructions](./resources/environment-instructions/stata.md)
