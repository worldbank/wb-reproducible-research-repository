# 📦 Package Data Folder

This file is intentionally included in the repository to ensure GitHub tracks this folder existence.

🗂️ In this folder, you should place the **datasets shared by authors** as part of the reproducibility package submission.

📌 Files placed here will be compared to their public equivalents in the `public/` folder during the reproducibility verification process.

📎 Note: Filenames (excluding extensions) must match those in the `public/` folder to be correctly compared.
